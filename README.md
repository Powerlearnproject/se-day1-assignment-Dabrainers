Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves designing, developing and testing software applications and computer applications aimed at solving real life problems and make our lives easier.
Software engineering importance is seen in development of new applications and technological solutions through innovation aimed at solving problems in the society. For instance, we are able to make e-wallet transactions through well designed and maintained software applications. In addition, sofware engineering advancements such as Generative AI, has made it work easier for people in the technology industry as they can work on complex activities while AI and other technological solutions handles the routine less complex activities, for instance, testing and debugging of software applications has been made easier through Generative AI such as ChatGPT. This has improved efficiency and productictivity. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
